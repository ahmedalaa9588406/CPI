# AI-Powered Data Collection and Quality Improvements

This implementation addresses the problem statement by enhancing the City Prosperity Index (CPI) application with AI-powered data collection, integration, and quality improvements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement Addressed

> **Improving Data Collection and Quality**: AI can help gather, integrate, and harmonize vast amounts of diverse city data from multiple sources such as sensors, satellites, social media, and administrative records with higher accuracy and frequency. This addresses the challenge of inconsistent or incomplete data in CPI indicators.

> **Machine Learning for Data Gaps**: Machine learning algorithms can fill data gaps by predicting missing values or estimating hard-to-measure indicators based on available proxies, improving the reliability of the index.

## ðŸš€ Implementation Overview

### Core AI Service (`/lib/ai-data-service.ts`)

The `AIDataService` class provides four main capabilities:

#### 1. **Missing Value Prediction**
- Uses correlation-based machine learning to predict missing CPI indicators
- Leverages established relationships between urban indicators (e.g., GDP â†” education â†” health)
- Provides confidence scores based on data availability and correlation strength
- Includes fallback statistical methods (median estimation) when correlations are insufficient

```typescript
// Example: Predict life expectancy based on available economic and environmental data
const prediction = await aiDataService.predictMissingValue(
  'life_expectancy_at_birth',
  userId,
  {
    city_product_per_capita: 15000,
    literacy_rate: 85,
    pm25_concentration: 25
  }
);
// Returns: { predictedValue: 72.5, confidence: 0.8, method: 'correlation-based' }
```

#### 2. **Data Quality Validation**
- Statistical analysis using Interquartile Range (IQR) for outlier detection
- Source reliability assessment based on confidence scores
- Temporal data quality checks for recency
- Actionable recommendations for data improvement

```typescript
const validation = aiDataService.validateDataQuality(dataPoints);
// Returns quality score, issues detected, and improvement recommendations
```

#### 3. **Multi-Source Data Integration**
- Harmonizes data from sensors, satellites, administrative records, and APIs
- Weighted averaging based on source confidence and data recency
- Handles conflicting values from different sources intelligently

```typescript
const harmonized = aiDataService.harmonizeMultiSourceData(multiSourceData);
// Returns harmonized value with combined confidence score
```

#### 4. **External Data Collection Simulation**
- Simulates integration with external data sources
- Provides realistic data variance and noise modeling
- Includes metadata for source tracking and quality assessment

### API Integration (`/app/api/ai-data/route.ts`)

RESTful API endpoints expose AI capabilities:
- `POST /api/ai-data` with `action: 'predict_missing'`
- `POST /api/ai-data` with `action: 'validate_quality'`
- `POST /api/ai-data` with `action: 'harmonize_data'`
- `POST /api/ai-data` with `action: 'collect_external'`

### React Components

#### AIDataAssistant (`/components/AIDataAssistant.tsx`)
- Reusable component for any CPI indicator input form
- Provides real-time AI suggestions and external data options
- Integrates seamlessly with existing manual input workflows
- Shows confidence levels and data sources for transparency

#### DataQualityDashboard (`/components/DataQualityDashboard.tsx`)
- Comprehensive overview of data completeness and quality
- AI-powered recommendations for data collection priorities
- Visual progress tracking and quality scoring
- Batch prediction capabilities for multiple missing indicators

### Enhanced User Experience

#### Integrated AI Assistance
The AI assistant has been integrated into existing indicator pages:

1. **PM10 Monitoring Stations** (`/app/home/ES/AQ/Number_of_Monitoring_Stations/page.tsx`)
2. **Renewable Energy Share** (`/app/home/ES/SE/Share_of_Renewable_Energy_Consumption/page.tsx`)

#### New AI Insights Page (`/app/ai-insights/page.tsx`)
- Dedicated dashboard for AI-powered data insights
- Explains AI implementation and methodologies
- Provides comprehensive data quality analysis

## ðŸ§  AI Algorithms & Methodologies

### Correlation-Based Prediction
```typescript
// Core prediction algorithm
const correlations = {
  'life_expectancy_at_birth': {
    'city_product_per_capita': 0.70,
    'literacy_rate': 0.65,
    'pm25_concentration': -0.55
  }
};

// Weighted prediction calculation
let weightedSum = 0;
let totalWeight = 0;
for (const [indicator, correlation] of Object.entries(correlations)) {
  if (availableData[indicator]) {
    const weight = Math.abs(correlation);
    weightedSum += availableData[indicator] * correlation * weight;
    totalWeight += weight;
  }
}
const predictedValue = weightedSum / totalWeight;
```

### Data Quality Assessment
```typescript
// Outlier detection using IQR method
const sorted = values.sort((a, b) => a - b);
const q1 = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length * 0.25)];
const q3 = sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length * 0.75)];
const iqr = q3 - q1;
const outliers = values.filter(v => 
  v < q1 - 1.5 * iqr || v > q3 + 1.5 * iqr
);
```

### Multi-Source Harmonization
```typescript
// Weighted averaging with confidence and recency
for (const dataPoint of dataPoints) {
  const recencyWeight = Math.exp(-daysSince / 30);
  const weight = dataPoint.source.confidence * recencyWeight;
  weightedSum += dataPoint.value * weight;
  totalWeight += weight;
}
```
